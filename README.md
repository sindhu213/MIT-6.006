# Introduction to Algorithms - C++ Implementations
This repository contains the implementations of various algorithms covered in the MIT 6.006 (Introduction to Algorithms) course, offered in Fall 2011. The algorithms are implemented in C++ and accompanied by a brief analysis of their complexity and other relevant details.

## Contents
So far, the repository includes the following algorithms:
* [Insertion Sort](https://github.com/sindhu213/MIT-6.006/blob/main/Lecture03/InsertionSort.cpp)
* [Binary Insertion Sort](https://github.com/sindhu213/MIT-6.006/blob/main/Lecture03/BinaryInsertionSort.cpp)
* [Merge Sort](https://github.com/sindhu213/MIT-6.006/blob/main/Lecture03/MergeSort.cpp)
* [Heap Sort](https://github.com/sindhu213/MIT-6.006/blob/main/Lecture04/HeapSort.cpp)
* [Binary Search Trees (BSTs)](https://github.com/sindhu213/MIT-6.006/blob/main/Lecture05/BinarySearchTrees.cpp)


## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or additional algorithms that you would like to add to the repository, please feel free to submit a pull request.
